Hello {seeker_name} and {sharer_name},

I hope this message finds you well. We're delighted that you've chosen to use the “Invite to Meet” service on Miumee, and we're excited to help facilitate a meaningful connection between you both.

{seeker_name}, your interest in {sharer_name}'s post titled "{post_title}" has not gone unnoticed! To foster a deeper understanding and discussion about this topic, we're proposing a 20-minute meeting at a mutually convenient time.

**Meeting Details**:

- **Duration**: 20 minutes
- **Tentative Schedule**: {available_time}
- **Meeting Fee**: As our payment functionality is in development, Miumee is waiving the usual platform fee for this session. Instead, we kindly ask that the agreed-upon compensation {meet_charge} be directly provided to {sharer_name} by you, {seeker_name}, following the meeting.

{sharer_name}, could you please confirm your availability during the proposed time or suggest an alternative that works better for you?

{seeker_name}, once we have {sharer_name}'s confirmation, please confirm the meeting details.

Thank you for being an active part of the Miumee community.

Looking forward to your responses and to facilitating this exciting exchange!

We are still building the meeting service, please kindly provide us with suggestions on how we can improve it.


Warmest regards,

Miumee
